Changes from distribution 1.6 to 1.6.1:
---------------------------------------

Classes for Mouse tools: Generate, TestParser, TestPEG, TryParser,  
and MakeRuntime are made public.

Option --mode=755 is added to the 'tar' command used to create 
Mouse-1.6.1.tar. This should set the correct permission bits 
when the archive is unpacked under Unix. (The original files 
and directories are under Windows, and have different permissions, 
not copied by 'tar'.)


Changes from distribution 1.5.1 to 1.6:
---------------------------------------

'TestParser' can optionally write its output in the form of
comma-separated values (CSV) that can be imported into a spreadsheet
application. This is controlled by option '-C'.

'TryParser' and 'TestParser' may optionally write timing information.
This is controlled by option '-t'.

The output format of both 'TryParser' and 'TestParser' is slightly
changed: file name precedes output from the parser under test.

Three bugs fixed:
- A semicolon generated after 'while' caused infinite
  loop in an internal parsing procedure with a body
  consisting of a '*+' expression only.
- Omitted '-S' option to Generate ignored the package specified
  by '-r' when defining SemanticBase.
- 'rhsText' did not return empty string for empty range.


Changes from distribution 1.5 to 1.5.1:
---------------------------------------

Bug fix and clean-up due to Stephen P. Owens (steve@doitnext.com).

Fixed bug: after parser failure, printed a blank line if the error message
was intercepted by semantics and error info cleared using errClear().

Clean-up: removed unused variables and imports from six source files.


Changes from distribution 1.4 to 1.5:
-------------------------------------

Identity of rule that created a Phrase made available 
to semantic procedures via helper methods 'rule' and 'isTerm'.

Bug fixed in the generated parser: 
incorrect handling of ^[s] when s has length 1.

Build file provided for compiling the source and making the jars:
'build.xml' for Apache Ant. Invocation is described in a comment. 


Changes from distribution 1.3.1 to 1.4:
---------------------------------------

Shorthand forms introduced for three frequently used
constructions. They are easier to read and have
a more efficient implementation.

- e1*+ e2. A shorthand for (!e2 e1)*e2: 
  iterate e1 until e2. 
 
- e1++ e2. A shorthand for (!e2 e1)+e2: 
  iterate e1 at least once until e2.
  
- ^[s]. A shorthand for ![s]_: 
  consume character NOT appearing in string s.
  
Position of a Phrase in source text made available 
to semantic procedures via helper method 'where'.
(Feature request 3298666.)

A slightly better formulation for messages
about failing predicate !e.


Changes from distribution 1.3a to 1.3.1:
----------------------------------------

Two bugs fixed in the generated parser:

- the error message for failing predicate &e was 
  'expected not e' instead of 'expected e'.
  
- an attempt to print error position at the end of file
  resulted in an infinite loop.

One bug fixed in Generate:

- printed extra message 'expected : or end of input'
  for syntax error after last semicolon.

Two errors corrected in the sample grammar for Java 1.6.

Sample grammar for Java 1.7 added.


Change from distribution 1.3 to 1.3a:
-------------------------------------

Revised version of user's manual.


Changes from distribution 1.2 to 1.3:
-------------------------------------

In the generated parser, do not check for success
of expressions that never fail.

Default character encoding is assumed for the input file
(version 1.2 assumed ISO 8859_1). 
Can be changed by modifying 'runtime.SourceFile'.

The generated Java code uses ASCII encoding. 

Helper method 'errMsg' returns a 'readable' string: 
all characters outside the range 32-255 are represented
by Java escapes.

Improved diagnostics from TestPEG.

Minor bug fixes.

Sample grammars for Java and C are included in the package.
